# R shiny app
Link to R Shiny app: Measurements in cm of Species sepal L/W and petal L/W (shinyapps.io)
My app’s purpose is for the user to be able to select any 4 attributes (Petal Length, Petal Width,
Sepal Length, and Sepal Width) for the three species found in Edgar Anderson’s Iris dataset. My
app contains two tabs, one containing the interactive bar plot featuring a drop down menu and
the other displaying an introduction for the user. I included an introduction page because I
believe it is extremely important to explain your data to any user who may stumble upon it,
because it is good practice not to assume everyone in the audience has the background
knowledge to initially understand the data
